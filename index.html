                We were tasked to design a mechanism that would safely transport luggage from point A to B, without exceeding the constriction boundary.

            <h2 class="heading">The Process</h2>
            <p class="text">Given a clear goal, two actuator choices (linear and rotary), and a simple constriction, the design process began! From group brainstorming to design drawings to CAD models we landed on our final design. Using 3D printed parts and some screws and bolts our mechanism was complete. With Python, we created functions that would extract relevant data from the “airport data sheets”. We further coded the sorting portion regarding the Q-ARM (the robotic arm that would be placing luggage on our ramp or in the discard pile) and the actuators that made our mechanism function.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">My Contributions</h2>
            <p class="text">My success illustrating ideas through my initial CAD models led to aspects of my mockup being integrated into the final design, primarily the drawbridge mechanism. Additionally, I eagerly helped in the coding portion. I felt comfortable creating flowcharts and after completing my own code snippet I led the way in writing the group and mechanism (Q-ARM/Actuator) code.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">What I Learned</h2>
            <p class="text">From this project I learned more about 3D printing regarding 3D model preparation, print settings, and support implementation. Additionally, throughout this project I developed my initiative. When I took initiative on tasks the group felt more comfortable at the time, but they would then work more effectively on their tasks later on. Initiative led to a trustworthy and reliable group environment helping to shape a better product.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">The Outcome</h2>
            <p class="text">Our end product was not up to our expectations. Utilizing string to hold up the ramp with the help of our actuators was difficult due to positioning and actuator strength. I wonder what our outcome would be if we sacrificed creativity for a tried and true design (like a simple rotating ramp). Additionally, our group struggled with minimizing print time for our 3D pieces; I wonder how our design and outcome would change if we decided to use laser cutting which is quick and reliable.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">What I'd Do Different</h2>
            <p class="text">Throughout our design process we took advice too literally; we altered our design drastically to address criticism and potential issues. Looking back I wish we tried to stay true to our original design. Advice is useful, but we had the right idea and implementing most of the advice we were given created more complexities and likely led to less success.</p>
